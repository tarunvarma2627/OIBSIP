# OIBSIP-iris_flower_classification
Iris flower has three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ according to their
measurements. Now, here I have taken a CSV file which contains the data regarding the measurements
of the iris flowers according to their species, and I have trained a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.
